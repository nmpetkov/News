PNG files with transparency get a black part where the files where using the alpha channel.
This is solved by making sure the png files are using the alpha channel when generating the jpg
thumbnail.
by these lines in GdThumb.inc.php around line 114.
				// make sure transparency is handled correct
				imagealphablending($this->oldImage, true);
				//imagesavealpha($this->oldImage, true);

A better solution would be to scale png's to png's and not convert to jpg, but that will most probably not
be done with this plugin. A better solution would be to then use the Api of SimpleMedia2 and go from there.
